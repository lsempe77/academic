abstract = {This research analyzes a learning coaching strategy called Acompanamiento Pedagogico promoted by the ministry of Education of Peru since 2008 focusing in rural multi-grade (Spanish and bilingual) schools aiming to improve learning outcomes. It focuses on the learning achievements of its students and also seeks providing advice for improving functioning of the current strategy. The first goal was to determine if there is a significant difference in learning achievements in Spanish reading and comprehension and mathematics between coached and non-coached schools and were performed mixed-designed ANOVAs tests. The finding of statistically significant interactions between receiving coaching for 3-years disclosures an effective strategy in order to increase the goal of any educational system, the learning of students. The second goal of the research was analyzing if the present learning coaching strategy meets the standards set by the national results-based budgeting approach. For that purpose, a documentary review of policy design, focalization and expenditure were performed, finding a design inconsistency, some coverage problems and absence of clear standards and organization parameters.},

abstract = {Strengths and limitations of this study ► This is a timely systematic review of interventions involving integrated care for older people, situated within a policy framework that focuses on a new concept of avoidable displacement from home. ► This review examines interventions addressing a significant public health and social care challenge. ► Evidence in this area is predominately from quasi-experiments and observational studies with a number of studies presenting unclear results and ambiguity regarding the effectiveness of the interventions on hospital and emergency department admissions and readmissions. ABSTRACT Objectives To synthesise existing literature on interventions addressing a new concept of avoidable displacement from home for older people with multimorbidity or frailty. The review focused on home-based interventions by any type of multidisciplinary team aimed at reducing avoidable displacement from home to hospital settings. A second objective was to characterise these interventions to inform policy. Design A systematic search of the main bibliographic databases was conducted to identify studies relating to interventions addressing avoidable displacement from home for older people. Studies focusing on one specific condition or interventions without multidisciplinary teams were excluded. A narrative synthesis of data was conducted, and themes were identified by using an adapted thematic framework analysis approach.. Overall 3927 articles were identified and 364 were retained for full text screening. Fifteen studies were included in the narrative review. Four themes were identified and discussed: (1) types of interventions, (2) composition of teams, (3) intervention effectiveness and (4) types of outcomes. Within intervention types, three categories of care types were identified; transitional care, case-management services and hospital at home. Each individual article was assessed in terms of risk of bias following Cochrane Collaboration guidelines. Conclusions The review identified some potential interventions and relevant topics to be addressed in order to develop effective and sustainable interventions to reduce the avoidable displacement from home of older people. However the review was not able to identify robust impact evidence, either in terms of quantity or quality from the studies presented. As such, the available evidence is not sufficiently robust to inform policy or interventions for reducing avoidable displacement from home. This finding reflects the complexity of these interventions and a lack of systematic data collection. PROSPERO registration number CRD42018108116.},

abstract = {Abstract: The increasing numbers of people at very old ages pose specific policy challenges for health and social care and highlight the need to rethink established models of service provision. The main objective of this paper is to introduce the concept of “avoidable displacement from home” (ADH). The study argues that ADH builds on and adds value to existing concepts, offering a holistic, person-centered framework for integrated health and social care provision for older people. It also demonstrates that this framework can be applied across different levels, ranging from macro policymaking to organizational and individual decision-making. The paper pays attention to the Brazilian context but argues that ADH is a universally applicable concept.},
