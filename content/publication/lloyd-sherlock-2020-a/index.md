abstract: 'Abstract: The increasing numbers of people at very old ages pose specific
  policy challenges for health and social care and highlight the need to rethink established
  models of service provision. The main objective of this paper is to introduce the
  concept of “avoidable displacement from home” (ADH). The study argues that ADH builds
  on and adds value to existing concepts, offering a holistic, person-centered framework
  for integrated health and social care provision for older people. It also demonstrates
  that this framework can be applied across different levels, ranging from macro policymaking
  to organizational and individual decision-making. The paper pays attention to the
  Brazilian context but argues that ADH is a universally applicable concept.'
