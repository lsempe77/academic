abstract: This research analyzes a learning coaching strategy called Acompanamiento
  Pedagogico promoted by the ministry of Education of Peru since 2008 focusing in
  rural multi-grade (Spanish and bilingual) schools aiming to improve learning outcomes.
  It focuses on the learning achievements of its students and also seeks providing
  advice for improving functioning of the current strategy. The first goal was to
  determine if there is a significant difference in learning achievements in Spanish
  reading and comprehension and mathematics between coached and non-coached schools
  and were performed mixed-designed ANOVAs tests. The finding of statistically significant
  interactions between receiving coaching for 3-years disclosures an effective strategy
  in order to increase the goal of any educational system, the learning of students.
  The second goal of the research was analyzing if the present learning coaching strategy
  meets the standards set by the national results-based budgeting approach. For that
  purpose, a documentary review of policy design, focalization and expenditure were
  performed, finding a design inconsistency, some coverage problems and absence of
  clear standards and organization parameters.
