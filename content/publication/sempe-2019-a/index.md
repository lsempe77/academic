abstract: 'Strengths and limitations of this study ► This is a timely systematic review
  of interventions involving integrated care for older people, situated within a policy
  framework that focuses on a new concept of avoidable displacement from home. ► This
  review examines interventions addressing a significant public health and social
  care challenge. ► Evidence in this area is predominately from quasi-experiments
  and observational studies with a number of studies presenting unclear results and
  ambiguity regarding the effectiveness of the interventions on hospital and emergency
  department admissions and readmissions. ABSTRACT Objectives To synthesise existing
  literature on interventions addressing a new concept of avoidable displacement from
  home for older people with multimorbidity or frailty. The review focused on home-based
  interventions by any type of multidisciplinary team aimed at reducing avoidable
  displacement from home to hospital settings. A second objective was to characterise
  these interventions to inform policy. Design A systematic search of the main bibliographic
  databases was conducted to identify studies relating to interventions addressing
  avoidable displacement from home for older people. Studies focusing on one specific
  condition or interventions without multidisciplinary teams were excluded. A narrative
  synthesis of data was conducted, and themes were identified by using an adapted
  thematic framework analysis approach.. Overall 3927 articles were identified and
  364 were retained for full text screening. Fifteen studies were included in the
  narrative review. Four themes were identified and discussed: (1) types of interventions,
  (2) composition of teams, (3) intervention effectiveness and (4) types of outcomes.
  Within intervention types, three categories of care types were identified; transitional
  care, case-management services and hospital at home. Each individual article was
  assessed in terms of risk of bias following Cochrane Collaboration guidelines. Conclusions
  The review identified some potential interventions and relevant topics to be addressed
  in order to develop effective and sustainable interventions to reduce the avoidable
  displacement from home of older people. However the review was not able to identify
  robust impact evidence, either in terms of quantity or quality from the studies
  presented. As such, the available evidence is not sufficiently robust to inform
  policy or interventions for reducing avoidable displacement from home. This finding
  reflects the complexity of these interventions and a lack of systematic data collection.
